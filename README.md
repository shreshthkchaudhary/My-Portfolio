# My Portfolio Website  

This is my **first website project**, titled *"My Portfolio"*. The project is built completely using **HTML5** where I practiced using multiple tags and attributes to create a structured layout for a portfolio page.

### 📑 Project Structure  

The website follows a basic HTML document setup:  

- **Structure & Metadata**  
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>` → Declares the document as HTML5.  
  - `<html lang="en">` → Defines root and sets the language to English.  
  - `<head>` → Includes metadata: title, character set, and viewport for responsiveness.  
  - `<title>` → Sets the page title visible in the browser tab.  

- **Body & Sections**  
  - `<header>` → Contains the main **site title/logo** and navigation menu.  
  - `<nav>` with `<a>` → Navigation bar with links to sections.  
  - `<section>` → Different sections for *About Me*, *Projects*, *Skills*, etc.  
  - `<h1>`, `<h3>` → Headings for content hierarchy.  
  - `<p>`, `<i>`, `<b>` → Text formatting for emphasis.  
  - `<img>` → Profile picture with size adjustments.  
  - `<aside>` → Side note content.  
  - `<ul>` and `<li>` → Lists for hobbies/skills.  

- **Skills Table**  
  - `<table border="1">` → Table to represent coding/software skills.  
  - `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>` → Structure of rows, headers, and data cells.  

- **Contact Form**  
  - `<form>` with `<label>` and `<input>` fields for text, email, and message.  
  - `<textarea>` → Multi-line message input.  
  - `<input type="submit">` → Button to send details.  

- **Footer**  
  - `<footer>` → Contact handles at the bottom.  
  - Social media icons and email link with `mailto:` feature.  
  - Clickable images inside `<a>` tags.
